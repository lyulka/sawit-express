Export

The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export functions,
objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs
with the import statement.

Exported modules are in strict mode whether you declare them as such or not. The
export statement cannot be used in embedded scripts.

There are two types of exports:
1. Named Exports (Zero or more exports per module)
2. Default Exports (One per module)

Named exports are useful to export several values. During the import, it is
mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.

But a default export can be imported with any name.
