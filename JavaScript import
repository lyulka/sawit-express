Import

The static import statement is used to import bindings which are exported by
another module. Imported modules are in strict mode whether you declare them
as such or not. The import statement cannot be used in embedded scripts unless
such script has a type='module'

There is also a function-like dynamic import(), which does not require scripts
of type='module'

Backward compatibiity can be ensured using attribute nomodule on the script tag.
