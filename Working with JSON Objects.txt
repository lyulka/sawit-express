JSON

We mentioned that JSON text basically looks like a JavaScript object, 
and this is mostly right. The reason we said "mostly right" is that an 
array is also valid JSON.

Other notes:

- JSON is a purely data format - it contains only properties, no methods.
- JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and property names.
Single quotes are not valid.
- Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and 
not work. YOu should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (
although computer-generated JSON is less likely to induce errors, as long as
the generator program is working correctly). You can validate JSON using an
application like JSONLint.
- JSON can actually take the form of any data type that is valid for inclusion
inside JSON, not just arrays or objects. So for example, a single string or
number would be a valid JSON object.
- Unlike a JavaScript code in which object properties may be unquoted, in JSON
only quoted strings may be used as properties.
